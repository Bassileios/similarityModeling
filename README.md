# similarityModeling
Implementation of Similarity modeling projects 1&amp;2
## Problem
- For SM1 detection if Kermit the forg is visible.
- For SM@ detection if the pigs are visible.

## Approach
In this project classical feature enigneering approach was used for detection of kermit and deep learning for the pigs.

## SM1 (detection of Kermit using classical feature enigneering approach)
### Audio classification
### Video classification

## SM2 (Detection fo the pigs using deep learing approach)
### Audio classification
### Video classification

## Work-Breakdown
- Labeling the data (one frame will be extracted from each second in the video and labeled) 10h
- Researching the best approach for audio/video analysis 20h
- Designing the network 5h
- training the model 5h
- Implementing the classical appproach 20h
- testing/debugging 10h
